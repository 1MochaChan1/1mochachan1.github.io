An ambitious 3D RPG project set in a post-apocalyptic world. Originally developed as a learning project in 2024, this game is no longer in active development.

## What Was It?

Forgotten Realm was envisioned as a sprawling RPG featuring:

- Open-world exploration with dynamic weather
- 3D models created entirely in Blender
- Turn-based combat system
- Multiple character classes and progression

## Why It Was Abandoned

This project taught me a lot about scope management and my true interests in game development. I realized that I'm more passionate about focused, atmospheric experiences rather than large-scale RPGs.

## What I Learned

- Importance of prototyping before full production
- 3D pipeline optimization with Blender
- The value of smaller, more manageable project scopes

The lessons learned here directly influenced the design of my current projects!
